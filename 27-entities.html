<h1>27. Entities</h1>

<p>Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.<br><br>

Characters that are not present on your keyboard can also be replaced by entities. Some characters are reserved in HTML - if you use &lt; or &gt; in your text your browser will mix them with tags.<br><br>

Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.:<br><br>

<code id="chu"><textarea>
&entity_name;

OR

&#entity_number;
</textarea></code><br>

To display the less than sign, we must write & lt; or & #60; (without spaces).</p>

<h2>Non-breaking Space</h2>

<p>A common character entity used in HTML is the non-breaking space, or & nbsp; (again without the space) - this is a space that will not break into a new line. This avoids browsers from truncating multiple spaces<br><br>

This is similar to the non-breaking hyphen (& #8209;) lets you use a hyphen character (-) that won't break</p>
